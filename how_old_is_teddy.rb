    1. Understand the problem
        Build a program that randomly generates and prints Teddy's age. To get
        the age, you should generate a random number between 20 and 200.

        Example Output

        Teddy is 69 years old!

    2. Set up your test cases

    3. Describe your inputs, outputs, and data structures

    4. Describe your algorithm

    5. Begin coding
=end

puts "Teddy is #{rand(20..200)} years old!"
